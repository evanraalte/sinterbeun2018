# Sinterbeun 2k18

This repo contains the source code for the Sinterbeun 2018 project. Sinterklaas is a dutch party where you give each other presents, lets involve electronics also! 

The audio files are located in the audio folder. The files can be converted to C header using the `convertMoveAll.sh` script. Beware that you only execute this script in the audio folder, since the script is pretty beun :). If the header is too large for the flash, then you can decrease the sample size in the `convertMoveAll.sh'` script.

You should be able to program the software if you use platformIO.
